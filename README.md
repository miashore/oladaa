# oladaa - Your Activity Companion

## What We Do

#### We recommend activities based on your activity level from the day before and on events going on in your local community. 
If you're very active, we suggest activities that will de-stress and relax you; if you work a desk job and want to become more active, we find events you'd like that will get you moving!
    - Currently fully functional in Southern California
    
- We hope to expand to other technologies (Jawbone, Garmin, etc.), allow users to save events, incorporate more event/activity APIs, add social elements for users to interact with each other, and utilize React Native for a fully mobile app.

#### Target Demographic

- People in their 20s to 40s who are active or wanting to become active. At this point in time, Fitbit owners in particular are our main audience--we expect to expand to other active lifestyle technologies.
